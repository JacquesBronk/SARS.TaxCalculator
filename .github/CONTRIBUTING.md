- ‚úÖ **Security Scan** - No security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ **98%+ Test Coverage** - Maintain high test coverage

### Pull Request Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Require pull request reviews** - At least 1 approval required
- ‚úÖ **Require review from code owners** - [@JacquesBronk](https://github.com/JacquesBronk)
- ‚úÖ **Dismiss stale reviews** - New commits dismiss old approvals
- ‚úÖ **Require up-to-date branches** - Branch must be current with main
- ‚úÖ **Require conversation resolution** - All comments must be resolved

### Restrictions

- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
- Update XML documentation for all public members
- Verify SARS compliance for any tax calculation changes

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Check test coverage (should be 98%+)
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Verify no XML documentation warnings
dotnet build --verbosity normal

# Check formatting
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new ETI calculation feature

- Implement new ETI rate for 2026
- Add comprehensive tests covering edge cases
- Update documentation with SARS citations
- Maintain 98%+ test coverage"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request
