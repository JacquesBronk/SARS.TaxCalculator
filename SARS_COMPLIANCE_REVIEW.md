## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive review of the SARS Tax Calculator's compliance with South African Revenue Service (SARS) legislation and tax code requirements.

## Tax Year Coverage
The calculator supports tax years 2023-2026 with configurations based on official SARS announcements:

### Tax Brackets and Rates
**Source**: [SARS Tax Rates for Individuals](https://www.sars.gov.za/tax-rates/income-tax/rates-of-tax-for-individuals/)

All tax years (2024-2026) maintain the same tax brackets as announced by SARS:
- 18% on taxable income up to R237,100
- 26% on income from R237,101 to R370,500
- 31% on income from R370,501 to R512,800
- 36% on income from R512,801 to R673,000
- 39% on income from R673,001 to R857,900
- 41% on income from R857,901 to R1,817,000
- 45% on income above R1,817,000

### Tax Rebates (All Years)
- Primary rebate (under 65): R17,235
- Secondary rebate (65-74): R9,444
- Tertiary rebate (75+): R3,145

### Tax Thresholds (All Years)
- Under 65: R95,750
- 65-74: R148,217
- 75+: R165,689

## PAYE Calculations

### Legal Framework
- **Source**: Fourth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1962
- **Reference**: SARS Guide for Employers in Respect of Employees' Tax

### Calculation Methodology
1. Calculate gross tax using progressive tax brackets
2. Apply age-based rebates
3. Apply medical aid credits
4. Check against tax thresholds
5. Round to nearest cent using `Math.Round(value, 2, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero)`

### Rounding Rules
**Source**: SARS validation rules specify cents must be included for tax amounts
- PAYE amounts: Rounded to nearest cent (2 decimal places)
- Final PAYE calculation uses standard currency rounding

## Employment Tax Incentive (ETI)

### Legal Framework
- **Source**: Employment Tax Incentive Act, 2013 (Act No. 26 of 2013)
- **Reference**: [SARS ETI Guide](https://www.sars.gov.za/types-of-tax/pay-as-you-earn/employment-tax-incentive-eti/)

### Current Implementation (2024-2025)
- Age eligibility: 18-29 years
- Maximum qualifying salary: R7,500 per month
- ETI bands with reduction rates for higher salaries

### ETI Calculation Bands
1. **R0 - R2,000**: R1,500 (Year 1), R750 (Year 2)
2. **R2,001 - R4,500**: R1,500 (Year 1), R750 (Year 2), 50% reduction rate
3. **R4,501 - R6,500**: R750 (Year 1), R375 (Year 2), 25% reduction rate
4. **R6,501 - R7,500**: R0 (No ETI)

### Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Provisions
- SEZ employees are exempt from age restrictions
- **Source**: Employment Tax Incentive Act - SEZ provisions

### ETI Rounding Rules
**Source**: [SARS Validation Rules for Reconciliation Declarations 2025](https://www.sars.gov.za/guide-for-validation-rules-applicable-to-reconciliation-declarations-2025/)

- **Rule**: "All cents for Rands must be dropped off" (truncated to whole Rands)
- **Exception**: Tax, SDL and UIF amounts require cents - ETI is NOT in this exception list
- **Implementation**: `Math.Truncate(value)` to drop cents completely
- **Rationale**: ETI amounts must be in whole Rands when submitted on reconciliation forms (EMP201/EMP501)

### Upcoming ETI Changes (Effective 1 April 2025)
**Source**: [SARS ETI Changes Announcement](https://www.sars.gov.za/latest-news/employment-tax-incentive-eti-changes-with-effect-from-1-april-2025/)

- Maximum ETI amount increases from R2,000 to R2,500 for employees working 160+ hours
- Maximum remuneration threshold increases to R7,500
- Changes apply for remaining portion of 2025 tax year and continue into 2026

## UIF (Unemployment Insurance Fund)

### Calculation Rules
- **Rate**: 1% employee + 1% employer = 2% total
- **Ceiling**: R17,712 per month (2024-2026)
- **Rounding**: Rounded to nearest cent
- **Source**: Unemployment Insurance Act and SARS reconciliation rules

## SDL (Skills Development Levy)

### Calculation Rules
- **Rate**: 1% of annual payroll
- **Exemption**: Annual payroll below R500,000
- **Rounding**: Rounded to nearest cent
- **Source**: Skills Development Act and SARS validation rules

## Medical Aid Credits

### Current Rates (All Tax Years)
- Main member: R364 per month
- First dependent: R364 per month
- Additional dependents: R246 per month each

## Retirement Contributions

### Limits (All Tax Years)
- Maximum percentage: 27.5% of remuneration
- Annual cap: R350,000

## Rounding Strategy Summary

| Component | Rounding Method | Decimal Places | SARS Reference |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| PAYE Tax | Standard rounding | 2 (cents) | Validation rules - tax amounts require cents |
| UIF | Standard rounding | 2 (cents) | Validation rules - UIF amounts require cents |
| SDL | Standard rounding | 2 (cents) | Validation rules - SDL amounts require cents |
| ETI | Truncation | 0 (whole Rands) | Validation rules - "cents must be dropped off" |
| General amounts | Truncation | 0 (whole Rands) | Default validation rule |

## Compliance Verification

### Test Coverage
- All 159 tests pass
- Comprehensive coverage of edge cases and SARS-specific scenarios
- Tests validate rounding behavior according to SARS rules

### Key Compliance Areas Verified
1. ✅ Tax bracket calculations according to official SARS rates
2. ✅ Age-based rebate calculations
3. ✅ Medical aid credit calculations
4. ✅ ETI eligibility and calculation rules
5. ✅ Special Economic Zone exemptions
6. ✅ SARS-compliant rounding for all components
7. ✅ UIF ceiling and rate calculations
8. ✅ SDL exemption threshold handling

## Implementation Notes

### Monthly vs Annual PAYE Calculations
- Monthly PAYE calculated as: `(Annual PAYE / 12)` rounded to cents
- Slight differences between `Monthly PAYE × 12` and `Annual PAYE` are expected due to rounding
- Maximum difference should not exceed 12 cents per year

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive validation of input parameters
- Clear error messages for invalid scenarios
- Null reference protection throughout

## Future Considerations

### ETI 2025 Changes Implementation
When implementing ETI changes effective 1 April 2025:
1. Update ETI band amounts from R1,500/R750 to R2,500/R1,250
2. Ensure proper date-based logic for tax year transitions
3. Update test expectations accordingly
4. Maintain backward compatibility for historical calculations

### Maintenance Requirements
- Monitor SARS announcements for tax year changes
- Update configurations when official rates are announced
- Verify compliance with new SARS validation rules
- Update citations when SARS documentation changes
